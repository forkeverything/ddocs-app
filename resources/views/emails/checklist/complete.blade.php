Well done {{ $maker->name }}!
<br>
<br>
<strong>You've collected all the files for {{ $checklist->name }}.</strong>
<br>
<br>
And you did it all without updating spreadsheets, getting mixed up on file versions or dealing with messy file names!
<br>
<br>
If you liked using Files Collector, we'd really appreciate it if you could tell us a little about your experience. Perhaps about features you wish we had or things you feel we didn't need?
