Hi {{ $user->name }},
<br>
<br>
Thanks for creating an account with us at FilesCollector!
<br>
<br>
<strong>What Happens Now?</strong>
<br>
<br>
Whenever you need files from someone and create a list of files at filescollector.com. We'll work our magic and help you collect the right files at the right time. Starting by telling the recipient that you've kindly requested some files from them.
And when there are due files coming up, we'll casually remind them for you too. Of course, when they're running a bit late, we'll give them a tiny nudge in the right direction.
Finally, we'll even sort, index and make all the files searchable. So you never have to worry about losing track of files or progress again.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sounds Good, Let's Get Started!</strong>
<br>
<br>
Once you're ready, click <a href="{{ env('DOMAIN') }}/checklist/make">here</a> to make your first checklist.
<br>
If you've already made you're first checklist, sit back, enjoy your americano (or chai latte if that's how you roll) and let us take care of the rest.
<em>We'll send you another email as soon as we're done collecting all your files.</em>
<br>
<br>
We hope you enjoy using our service. Thanks again for helping us get one step closer to a world
where no files are left behind, or forgotten.
