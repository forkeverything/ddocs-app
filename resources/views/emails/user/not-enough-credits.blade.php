Hi {{ $user->name }},
<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for using our service!

<strong>Unfortunately, it looks like we couldn't create your last checklist because you've ran out of credits.</strong>

To keep on using Files Collector for your file collection, you'll need to do one of the following:
<br>
<br>
a) Subscribe to our services ($15/month) and get unlimited lists
<br>
b) Ask previous recipients to join. You get bonus credits when recipients sign up and create accounts!
<br>
c) Wait until the beginning of next month.
<br>
<br>
Sorry to put you on the spot but it's the only way we can keep our servers affordable, and help as many people (handle their files) as we can.
